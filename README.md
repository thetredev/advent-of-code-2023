# Advent of Code - 2023

With the help of this repository I try to solve [Advent of Code - 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), each day with a set of programming languages defined below to challenge myself.

Eventually this will give me an overview of how familiar I am with the different programming languages out there.

# Programming Languages

I'm grouping each of the programming languages I will use in difficulty levels which fit my experience with them.

As you can see, there's no Assembly or TypeScript... because no.

## Easy
| Number | Language | Experience (in years) | Experience (descriptive) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Python | 17 | First language, native speaker |
| 2 | C\# (.NET 8.0) | 5 | Second language |
| 3 | Go | 1 | I can get around very well |

## Medium
| Number | Language | Experience (in years) | Experience (descriptive) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | C | 3 | Haven't used it consistently |
| 5 | C++ | 4 | Used it more than C |
| 6 | D | 0 | Never used it but it doesn't seem hard at first glance |
| 7 | Kotlin | 0 | Used it once for a very simple Android app with about 3 lines of code |
| 8 | JavaScript | 0 | Used it a bit back in the jQuery days, I don't know anything about it |

## Hard
| Number | Language | Experience (in years) | Experience (descriptive) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | Rust | 0 | Never used at all and it seems pretty hard |
| 10 | Bash | 5 | Technically not a programming language, though the challenge seems interesting |

# The process

I will try to write the most efficient code possible, first in Python. And from there I'll follow the tables above and see where this goes.

I'll optimize the code on the go. Won't pay too much attention to the commit history.

# Removed languages

- Removed Java because I remembered why I've always hated it
